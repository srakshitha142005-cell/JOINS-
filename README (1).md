
 Task 4 – SQL Joins (Data Analyst Internship)

This repository contains my work for **Task 4: SQL Intermediate – Joins** as part of the Data Analyst Internship.

The main goal of this task is to practice using **SQL JOINs** to combine multiple tables and answer basic business questions.


📌 What this task is about
In this task, I worked with an e-commerce style dataset and used:
- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN  

to analyze customers, orders, products, and categories.

---

  Tools Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL syntax)
- SQLite + DB Browser (for practice and exporting data)
- GitHub for submission

 🔹 joins_queries.sql
This file contains all the SQL queries used in the task, including:
- Joining customers and orders
- Finding customers who never placed orders
- Calculating product-wise revenue
- Calculating category-wise revenue
- Filtering sales by region and date

All queries are written clearly and commented for easy understanding.
